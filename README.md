🧠 RAG-Based Medical Document Question Answering System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload private medical PDFs and ask natural-language questions.
The system retrieves relevant document context using FAISS vector search and generates grounded, non-hallucinated answers using a Large Language Model — all through a Streamlit web interface.
